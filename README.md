## Chapter 1, Day 1
 - ***Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp***
 
   A blockchain is a decentralized database. In order to work in a decentralized manner, it has to have a way to allow each operator agree on what goes into the database and in the correct order. This is called consensus.  Different blockchains have different straties for this and the two most popular strategies are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). Blockchain is much more than currencies, currencies have been the first and most popular use case so far.  Over the next 5-10 years many things we do today online will migrate toward the blockchain in a utility like model of [hyperstructures](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html).

 - ***Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts***
  A smart contract allows users to configure a set of rules to the blockchain.  These rules are the foundation to decentralized applications.  In other words a smart contract is an implementation of a blockchain for a specific use case.  The use case could be for investing (Decentralized Finance), NFT's (for various reasons such as gaming, collecting, identity, etc), Voting (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations - DAO's), and many more.

 - ***Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.***
 A script is used to read from the blockchain while a transaction mutates the data in some way.  It's analagous to a GET vs a POST request or a GraphQL query vs mutation.  Additionally transactions require a fee while scripts are free to read from the blockchain.


## Chapter 2, Day 2
 - ***What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?***
  1. Safter & Security
  2. Clarity
  3. Approachability
  4. Developer Experience
  5. Resource Oriented Programming

 - ***In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?***
  Its a holistic approach that is intended to increase the adoptino of blockchain technology.  Having the best functionality (speed & security) does not mean much if developers dont understand how to build on it or dont enjoy building on it.  With all 5 pillars, the technology is likely to grow in its tech as well as in its application adoption.
